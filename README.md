First HW for Mobile Programming: Android App gives the user the current time in different locations/cities

Name of Application: Traveller Watch

Overview: This app gives the user the current time in 4 cities/states in the United States. Ideally this app would be able to collect the users location and display the time in the users current location, but as a first project, I thought just presetting the application to show the times in 4 unchangeable locations was a good start.

Usage Instructions: Upon launching the app, you will see four buttons which are your choices as far as your location is concerned, and once you click on the corresponding button for any city that you want to check the time of, you will be 
taken to a page that contains the name of your selected city, a picture of the city, and the current time in that city. You can hit the back button to go back to the screen with the city options and check out the time in a different city.

Running Requirements: This application requires an android device running at least Android v8.0.

Documentation and Resources Used: For this project, I partially completed a Udemy Course on android development and spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow. I also used google to download the images used and to check the time zones of the cities the app caters for.

What I Learned: For the creation of this app, I had to learn some basic Java, and understand how to navigate the behemoth that is the android developer studio. I also learned about layouts and how to transition back and forth from one layout to the other. I would say that the most interesting things I learned about were the onClick and Intent functions.
